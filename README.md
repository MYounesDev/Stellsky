🛠️ How We Built It
We started by designing a clean React frontend with wallet login and a personalized content dashboard.

The FastAPI backend handles all business logic, AI prompt generation, and database access.

The AI module uses LangChain to structure prompts, which are sent to Google Gemini LLM via API. Prompt responses are tailored to each user’s profile.

A dynamic NFT minting system was created using Stellar blockchain, where each user post is minted and stored with metadata that tracks engagement.

We avoided complex blockchain development by focusing on smart integrations — giving us Web3 benefits without heavy infrastructure.

For quick testing, we mocked the MongoDB dataset and trained the AI logic with sample prompts.

Everything was deployed using Render.com with free-tier hosting and .env configuration for secret handling.

📈 Impact & Potential
